# FlatJS

FlatJS is a simple language that is currently layered on, but can
eventually be embedded in, Javascript.

The purpose of FlatJS is to allow JS programs to use ArrayBuffer and
SharedArrayBuffer memory somewhat conveniently and with high
performance by layering structured types onto flat memory.

See SPEC.md for more.
