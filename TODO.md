Immediate things to do:

* Make spec.txt catch up with implementation, and rename as spec.md
* Flesh out README.md a little, link to spec
* More test cases
* Test on ray tracer
* Get rid of the rest arguments in virtual calls
* Atomics + synchronics
* File issues for or fix FIXME / TODO comments in the code
